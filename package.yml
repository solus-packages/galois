description: |
    Galois is a computer game of the "falling blocks" type, but with unique features. Unlike most other games of that type, it is not limited to blocks made of four two-dimensional, square bricks: you can choose among several different brick shapes, blocks composed of more or fewer bricks, and even between two- and three-dimensional games.
